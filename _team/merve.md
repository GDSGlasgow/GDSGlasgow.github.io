## Interests
missing data, augmented reality, geospatial data

## Bio
I am a PhD student in Geospatial Data Science at the University of Glasgow. My research focuses on the visualisation of missing geospatial data using Augmented Reality. Before beginning my PhD at the University of Glasgow, I worked as a research assistant and a teaching assistant in Türkiye. I completed dual bachelor's degrees in Computer Engineering and Industrial Engineering at Karabuk University. I earned my master's degree in Computer Engineering with a thesis titled 'GIS-based AR Application for Sightseeing Purposes: The Case of Safranbolu’.

## Research

Merve POLAT KAYALI is a PhD student in Geospatial Data Science at the University of Glasgow. Her research focuses on the visualisation of missing geospatial data using Augmented Reality. Outcomes because the data we cannot see may have the potential to mislead us. Handling them properly is necessary to get better and more reliable results for our research. Since missing data may significantly impact decision-making, it can be crucial to understand how to communicate it effectively. We need to ask whether missing data helps us understand the process and whether it is important for decision-making. Understanding the significance of the interaction with missingness may help us to improve the visualisation of missing geospatial data.
