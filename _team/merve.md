## Bio
I am a PhD student in Geospatial Data Science at the University of Glasgow. My research focuses on the visualisation of missing geospatial data using Augmented Reality. Before beginning my PhD at the University of Glasgow, I worked as a research assistant and a teaching assistant in Türkiye. I completed dual bachelor's degrees in Computer Engineering and Industrial Engineering at Karabuk University. I earned my master's degree in Computer Engineering with a thesis titled 'GIS-based AR Application for Sightseeing Purposes: The Case of Safranbolu’.
