## Bio
I have a wide-ranging educational background covering biology, economics, finance, mathematics and statistics and this includes Mastersâ€™ degrees in Economics, Business Administration and Data Analytics. Prior to taking up full-time academic research I was Chief Data Officer or Managing Director: Data for a people intelligence firm for almost 18 years; before that I was a banking Chief Economist. I started my career as a water quality scientist in Africa.

My research interests are in missing data and how it can affect the use of data in analytics, business decision-making and AI systems. This includes the ethical implications of data use, particularly when it is incomplete. I am currently a Fellow and GradStat of the Royal Statistical Society (RSS) and an Associate Member of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) as well as a Fellow of the Institute of Financial Markets, South Africa.  In the past I have been, among other things, a Member of the Institute of Directors and Fellow of the Chartered Management Institute.
