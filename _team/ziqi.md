My research focuses on the methodological development of spatially explicit statistical and machine learning models. I am one of the primary developers of multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR). I am also broadly interested in the application of advanced spatial analysis and modeling in the fields of public health, urban analytics, political geography, and remote sensing.

Prior to joining Glasgow in 2021, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I earned my PhD in Geography from Arizona State University in 2020. I also hold a MA in Geography from George Washington University, a BSc in Geomatics from the University of Waterloo, and a BEng in Remote Sensing from Wuhan University.
