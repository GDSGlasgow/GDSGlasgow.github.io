## Bio
Despite training as a geophysicist, I have been learning to be a computational geographer for the last 30 years. Before arriving at Glasgow, I was a software engineer at Astun Technology, providing support and training to users of FOSS4G. I am currently looking at the back end of a system to estimate building heights from missing GNSS signals. I am a charter member of the OSGEO foundation and am a moderator on gis.stackexchange.com.
