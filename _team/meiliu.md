## Bio
Dr. Meiliu Wu is a Lecturer (Tenured Assistant Professor) in Geospatial Data Science at the School of Geographical & Earth Sciences, University of Glasgow, UK. Her research focuses on exploring innovative applications and development of Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI). She is particularly interested in the rapid advancements in AI, foundation models (e.g., ChatGPT), and their potential to transform geospatial applications. Her long-term research goal is to pioneer the development of GeoAI Foundation Models, creating a multimodal learning framework that integrates spatial knowledge from multimodal data (e.g., text, images, audios, and videos), to enhance geospatial analysis and decision-making.
