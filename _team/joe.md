## Interests
mathematical modelling, machine learning, reverse emulation/parameter estimation, computer vision, remote sensing, public health, multi modal data 

## Bio
I am a research software engineer and data scientist within the team. I have a BSc in Physics from the University of Liverpool and a MSc in Mathematical Biology from Heriot Watt University. I have previously in the UK Health Security Agency as a mathematical modeller, focussing on the interface between data science/machine learning and traditional modelling techniques. My current work looks at geo-locating textual data using natural language processing. Iâ€™m also more broadly interested in promoting Research Software Engineering across the university and developing a community-of-practice which can provide RSEs with resources and networking opportunities.
