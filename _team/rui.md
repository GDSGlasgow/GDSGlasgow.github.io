## Bio
I obtained my master’s degree in Cartography and Geographic Information System from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and bachelor’s degree in Space Science and Technology from Shandong University, China. Before studying at Glasgow, I have several project experiences with topics of remote sensing of urban environment, urban functional area modelling and other GIS/Remote Sensing applications. My current work focuses on developing explainable GeoAI models for processing geospatial data.
