## Bio
Jeremiah completed his PhD in Geography at the University of Southampton under funding from the ESRC; he focused on urban expansion modelling, machine learning, and high-volume data processing. Prior to joining the University of Glasgow, Jeremiah was a lecturer and geospatial data scientist at the University of Liverpool’s Geographic Data Science Lab where he focused on computational social science and human environment-interfaces using remote sensing, high-volume historical data, and spatial simulations. 

Jeremiah currently leads the Geospatial Data Science Technology and Infrastructure sub-group while also: designing and implementing secure and efficient data pipelines/mobile applications/workflows for research analyses and data collection; leading group, university, and external trainings; and managing the group’s growing knowledge base while serving as an liaison to central IT.

Jeremiah is a member of the Society of Research Software Engineering, a member of PopGrid since 2016, and previously sat on the GISRUK board while co-hosting and organising the GISRUK 2022 conference.
