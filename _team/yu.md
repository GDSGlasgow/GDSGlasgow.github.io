## Bio
I am a PhD candidate in Geospatial Data Science, specializing in the intersection of urban studies and telecommunications. Before joining the current research team, I earned a master's degree from ESIEE-Paris and received an Outstanding International Graduate Award. I then accumulated six years of professional experience as a telecom engineer in France. My background includes both academic and professional expertise in data mining, network optimization, and signal processing. Currently at the University of Glasgow, my research is centred on developing novel data-driven methods for estimating building heights by leveraging ubiquitous cellular signals, with a focus on creating efficient and scalable solutions that have broad implications in smart cities.
