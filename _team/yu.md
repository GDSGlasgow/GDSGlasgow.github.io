## Bio
I am a PhD candidate in Geospatial Data Science, specializing in the intersection of urban studies and telecommunications. Before joining the current research team, I earned a master's degree from ESIEE-Paris and received an Outstanding International Graduate Award. I then accumulated six years of professional experience as a telecom engineer in France. My background includes both academic and professional expertise in data mining, network optimization, and signal processing. Currently at the University of Glasgow, my research is centred on developing novel data-driven methods for estimating building heights by leveraging ubiquitous cellular signals, with a focus on creating efficient and scalable solutions that have broad implications in smart cities. 

## Research

Yu Wang is a PhD student in the Geospatial Data Science Group at the University of Glasgow, supervised by Prof. Ana Basiri. His research focuses on exploring innovative methods for creating 3D urban city models using cellular mobile and GNSS signals. These detailed 3D models are crucial for urban micro-climate studies and air pollution analysis, and they have potential applications in future urban services, such as drone delivery. Facing the challenge of regularly updating these models to reflect changing urban landscapes, Yu is focused on developing cost-effective and efficient solutions using crowdsourced data. To facilitate this, he has created the ‘BitToBrick’ mobile app prototype, designed to collect specific data types that help interpret signal shadowing and interference with the surrounding environment into valuable 3D model information.
Prior to this, Yu worked as a telecom engineer at a French telecommunication operator firm and holds a bachelor's degree in Telecommunications, complemented by an engineering degree (equivalent to a Master's) from ESIEE-Paris.
