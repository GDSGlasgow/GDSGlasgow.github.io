challenges of ‘new forms of data’ such as missingness and biases. These solutions are based on the mindset that considers the bias, missingness, or low quality as a useful source of data to make inference about the underlying reasons for the missingness and bias. One application of this is extracting the 3D map of cities using the patterns of blockage, reflection, and attenuation of the GPS signals (or other similar signals), that are contributed by the volunteers/crowd.</p> <p>In the era of big data, open data, social media, and crowdsourced data when “we are drowning in data”, gaps and unavailability, representativeness, and bias issues associated with them may indicate some hidden problems or reasons of biases and missingness.

Understanding these complex relationships is essential for informed urban planning, yet previous research has struggled with fine-scale analysis over large areas due to data and methodological limitations. This study overcomes these challenges by leveraging high-resolution building footprint data and eXplainable AI (XAI). Focusing on England between 2017 and 2023, we first quantify and map the extent of new urban development and further model it as a function of population density, ethnic composition, and the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) using machine-learning algorithms. We then interpret the best-performing model with SHAP values and reveal a substantial nonlinear correlation between these demographic and socio-economic factors and new urban development. This analytical framework offers a novel, scalable, interpretable approach to fine-grained urban analysis, and, for the first time, provides a nationwide quantitative assessment of how population density, ethnic composition, and deprivation jointly shape urban development in England, thereby supporting evidence-based and equitable planning and policymaking.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten355352" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Exploring a diagnostic test for missingness at random</div> <div class="author"> <a href="/team/dominick">Dominick Sutton</a>, <a href="/team/ana">Anahid Basiri</a>, and <a href="/team/ziqi">Ziqi Li</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Mathematics</em>, May 2025 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Missing data remain a challenge for researchers and decision-makers due to their impact on analytical accuracy and uncertainty estimation. Many studies on missing data are based on randomness, but randomness itself is problematic. This makes it difficult to identify missing data mechanisms and affects how effectively the missing data impacts can be minimized. The purpose of this paper is to examine a potentially simple test to diagnose whether the missing data are missing at random. Such a test is developed using an extended taxonomy of missing data mechanisms. A key aspect of the approach is the use of single mean imputation for handling missing data in the test development dataset. Changing this to random imputation from the same underlying distribution, however, has a negative impact on the diagnosis. This is aggravated by the possibility of high inter-variable correlation, confounding, and mixed missing data mechanisms. The verification step uses data from a high-quality real-world dataset and finds some evidence-in one case-that the data may be missing at random, but this is less persuasive in the second case. Confidence in these results, however, is limited by the potential influence of correlation, confounding, and mixed missingness. This paper concludes with a discussion of the test’s merits and finds that sufficient uncertainties remain to render it unreliable, even if the initial results appear promising.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten352276" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Diagnosing spatial and temporal biases of OSM contributors: identifying differences between gender and age from an online survey</div> <div class="author"> Hyesop Shin, Zoe Garden, <a href="/team/guy">Guy Solomon</a>, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

However, the literature concerning volunteered geographic information (VGI) has demonstrated significant demographic participation biases across time and space. Understanding the significance and impacts of these biases is challenging due to privacy concerns, which lead to the (pseudo-)anonymity of contributors. Using a sample of 265 users, this paper statistically analyses edits to the crowdsourced mapping platform OpenStreetMap (OSM) to examine the impact of gender and age on spatial and temporal contribution patterns. We find that men aged in the Others group (i.e. below 25 or over 54) made more contributions during the week and at weekends than those in the Economically Active age group (i.e. age 25-54). Using the Kruskal-Wallis test to compare temporal contributions between gender groups, the Economically Active group showed a significant gender difference on both weekdays and weekends, as well as the hours of the day, with men making more contributions than women regardless of age category. Men in the Others group made the most contributions overall. Calculating the Simpson Index of Diversity for user edits reveals that women have more limited spatial interests (i.e. they contribute to fewer countries) than their male counterparts, suggesting particular spatial preferences by gender.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten349410" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Geospatial Data Quality in the Era of Generative AI: Can we Trust the Geographic Information Produced by Large Language Models?</div> <div class="author"> <a href="/team/joe">Joseph Shingleton</a>, and <a href="/team/ana">Ana Basiri</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> Feb 2025 </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten332243" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Construction enthusiasts versus demolition giants: insights from building footprint data in England</div> <div class="author"> <a href="/team/xinyi">Xinyi Yuan</a>, <a href="/team/ziqi">Ziqi Li</a>, <a href="/team/ana">Ana Basiri</a>, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

The study was conducted on the FCA ’Financial Lives Survey, 2020’, sourced from the Consumer Data Research Centre. The variable examined was ’Annual Household Income’ for England. Research has found that these two nonresponses can have different meanings and encode different information. In financial surveys ’Don’t know’ respondents were found to be different to those refusing to answer and those providing informative answers. Accordingly, these nonresponses should be treated as different categories, not just missing data. Indeed, some argue that ’Don’t know’ answers should be treated as a valid response. The analysis found evidence of clear differences between the two nonresponses. ’Prefer not to say’ respondents were more likely to withhold responses to other questions (answering ’Prefer not to say’ if possible) than were ’Don’t know’ respondents (e.g. for Gender, 48% versus 14%; Marital Status 52% versus 14%; Ethnicity, 61% versus 13%). In line with prior research there was a higher ’Prefer not to say’ nonresponse rate for those with more education, this time three times higher. Moran’s I was used to test for spatial characteristics. While both were found to have a spatial component, it was stronger for ’Prefer not to say’. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) also found evidence of a spatial component for both, there being a stronger component for ’Prefer not to say’. As a final test a crude imputation of these nonresponses was used to calculated annual household income and compared to ONS data. Using mean squared error against ONS data as a fit criterion, GWR-based coefficients improved the fit compared to complete case analysis. ’Prefer not to say’ data generated a closer fit than ’Don’t know’, indicating both a higher spatial and informational content.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten322014" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Enhancing Toponym Identification: Leveraging Topo-BERT and Open-source Data to Differentiate Between Toponyms and Extract Spatial Relationships</div> <div class="author"> <a href="/team/joe">Joseph Shingleton</a>, and <a href="/team/ana">Ana Basiri</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> May 2024 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Geoparsing, the process of linking locations within text to sets of geographic coordinates, plays an important role in the extraction and analysis of information from unstructured textual data. With the rapid growth in availability of user-generated data from online sources, there is increasing demand for reliable geoparsing methods. Central to many of these methods is the accurate identification of toponyms within text. For some applications, however, simple identification of toponyms is insufficient. Problems which require the association of a piece of text containing multiple toponyms to a singular location require a more nuanced approach. In this paper, we show that a transformer based deep learning model, is able to identify the subject toponym within a given text, and classify other toponyms in terms of their spatial relationship with the subject. We curate a dataset of text taken from Wikipedia pages representing 5252 locations, and use OpenStreetMap data to classify toponyms within the text in terms of their spatial relationship with the subject of each article. This dataset is then used to train a transformer based deep-learning model. On a human labelled test set, our model achieves an F1 score of 0.916 when identifying the subject toponym, and 0.884 and 0.793 when identifying toponyms representing parent and child locations of the subject, respectively. We also consider the more complex adjacent and crossing relationships - with the model achieving F1 scores of 0.548 and 0.704 in these categories, respectively.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten321323" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Where is the News?

Further, our model identifies likely parents of the subject toponym, potentially helping to improve later geolocation tasks.

Ultra-Wideband (UWB) signals, with their strong interference resistance and excellent time-domain resolution, are still under-researched in this area. In this work, we explore the potential of UWB signals in conducting HAR tasks. We collect a diverse UWB Channel Impulse Response (CIR) dataset in real-world indoor settings, incorporating recordings of six activities performed by volunteers and background CIR data. Our novel approach treats each CIR as a unique snapshot, capturing specific activities and creating a dynamic activity representation through concatenated feature vectors. A thorough grid search identified optimal parameters for constructing these vectors. In applying eleven different learning models for classification analysis on the dataset, it is generally observed that deep learning methods yielded enhanced classification accuracy compared to traditional machine learning techniques. Our research not only demonstrates the potential of UWB in HAR but also provides insights into effective feature vector creation and model performance.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten322282" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Evaluating Geotemporal Behaviours in OpenStreetMap Contributors</div> <div class="author"> <a href="/team/guy">Guy Solomon</a>, <a href="/team/dominick">Dominick Sutton</a>, <a href="/team/merve">Merve Polat Kayali</a>, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?

However, despite the wide use of OSM as one of the most successful crowdsourcing platforms, the under-representation of certain demographic groups amongst those who contribute information may ultimately mean this information favours the interests of some groups over others. This can result in misleading conclusions for analyses conducted on the basis of these data. This paper connects OSM user contributions to demographic data collected via a survey. It shows that, in relation to geographic diversity of contributions, men and women demonstrate distinct trends over time. It then considers the extent to which this observed pattern can be seen as influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this regard, it concludes that there does not appear to be a distinct ’pandemic effect’ divergent from longer-term trends.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten315801" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The impact of postures and moving directions in fire evacuation in a low-visibility environment</div> <div class="author"> Jingjing Yan, Gengen He, <a href="/team/ana">Anahid Basiri</a>, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

However, in evacuations, it is not always possible to keep an upright posture, hence atypical postures, such as stoop walking or crawling, may be required for survival. In this study, a novel 3D passive vision-aided inertial system (3D PVINS) for indoor positioning was used to track the movement of 20 volunteers during an evacuation in a low visibility environment. Participants’ walking speeds using trunk flexion, trunk-knee flexion, and upright postures were measured. The investigations were carried out under emergency and non-emergency scenarios in vertical and horizontal directions, respectively. Results show that different moving directions led to a roughly 43.90% speed reduction, while posture accounted for over 17%. Gender, one of the key categories in evacuation models, accounted for less than 10% of the differences in speed. The speeds of participants under emergency scenarios when compared to non-emergency scenarios was also found to increase by 53.92-60% when moving in the horizontal direction, and by about 48.28-50% when moving in the vertical direction and descending downstairs. Our results also support the social force theory of the warming-up period, as well as the effect of panic on the facilitating occupants’ moving speed.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten322794" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The Importance of Communication with Missing Data with Colours of Map for Decision-Making</div> <div class="author"> <a href="/team/merve">Merve Polat Kayali</a>, and <a href="/team/ana">Ana Basiri</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> Dec 2023 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Missing data is a growing issue in data-driven studies.

Understanding the significance of the interaction with missingness may help us to improve the visualisation of missing geospatial data. We have created a survey that includes some sentences, terms, graphs, maps, and colours we can encounter in daily life. However, all these expressions have some missingness in measuring participants’ perceptions and decision-making mechanisms. One hundred-one respondents from different demographics, all from the UK, participated in the survey. It aims to improve the visualisation of missinggeospatial data using the results of this research for future studies. But, in this paper, we specifically focus on the perception of representation of missingness with different colours on maps.

This paper examines the relationship between demographic characteristics and user contributions to OpenStreetMap (OSM), one of the most successful examples of a project reliant on VGI. It demonstrates statistically significant differences in the information provided by users of different genders, ages, and education-levels.

However, the financial cost associated with creating and updating 3D maps using the current state-of-the-art methods such as laser scanning and aerial photogrammetry are prohibitively expensive. To overcome this, researchers have proposed using GNSS signals to create 3D maps. This paper advances that family of methods by proposing and implementing a novel technique that avoids the difficult step of directly classifying GNSS signals into line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight classes by utilising edge detection techniques adapted from computer vision. This prevents classification biases and increases the range of environments in which GNSS-based 3D mapping methods can be accurately deployed. Being based on the patterns of blockage and attenuation of GNSS signals that are freely and globally available to receive by many mobile phones, makes the proposed technique a free, scalable and accessible solution. This paper also identifies some key indicators affecting data collection scalability and efficiency of the 3D mapping solution.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten321319" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Learning from data with structured missingness</div> <div class="author"> Robin Mitra, Sarah F.

Given the geography of congested roads, availability of required infrastructure and cost of transportation in cities, promoting active travel, including cycling, can be a good solution for commuting within built environments. Having a better understanding of the key drivers that may influence bike ridership can help with designing cities that accommodate cyclists’ needs for healthier citizens. This paper examines the built environment features that may affect commuting cyclists. We respectively employ Ordinary Linear Square (OLS) regression and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) for 136 Intermediate Zones of the city of Glasgow, UK. The results of GWR show that the significant local variation in green areas suggests that even though the global regression showed a negative association between the greenness and commute cycling, over half of the IZ areas had a strong positive association with the green areas. Building height and Public Transport Availability Index show geographic patterns where the residuals are fairly stationary across the study area with some clusters of high residuals. Performance wise, the results from GWR provided an R2 of 0.73 which was higher than OLS at 0.3.

This paper proposes and implements a novel approach to generate 2.5D (otherwise known as 3D level-of-detail (LOD) 1) maps for free using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals, which are globally available and are blocked only by obstacles between the satellites and the receivers. This enables us to find the patterns of GNSS signal availability and create 3D maps. The paper applies algorithms to GNSS signal strength patterns based on a boot-strapped technique that iteratively trains the signal classifiers while generating the map. Results of the proposed technique demonstrate the ability to create 3D maps using automatically processed GNSS data.

Many countries have been working towards developing suitable digital contact-tracing apps to allow the measurement of the physical distance between citizens and to alert them when contact with an infected individual has occurred. However, the adoption of digital contact-tracing apps has faced several challenges so far, including interoperability between mobile devices and users’ privacy concerns. There is a need to reach a trade-off between the achievable technical performance of new technology, false-positive rates, and social and behavioural factors. This paper reviews a wide range of factors and classifies them into three categories of technical, epidemiological and social ones, and incorporates these into a compact mathematical model. The paper evaluates the effectiveness of digital contact-tracing apps based on received signal strength measurements. The results highlight the limitations, potential and challenges of the adoption of digital contact-tracing apps.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten250461" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Identifying urban functional areas and their dynamic changes in Beijing: using multiyear transit smart card data</div> <div class="author"> Zijia Wang, Haixu Liu, Yadi Zhu, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 5 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '5 more authors' ?

Therefore, it is of great significance to investigate the distribution and evolution of a city’s urban functional areas over different periods of time. Although the smart card automated fare collection system is already widely used, few studies have used smart card data to infer information about changes in urban functional areas, particularly in developing countries. Thus, this research aims to delineate the dynamic changes that have occurred in urban functional areas based on passengers’ travel patterns, using Beijing as a case study. We established a Bayesian framework and applied a Gaussian mixture model derived from transit smart card data in order to gain insight into passengers’ travel patterns at station level and then identify the dynamic changes in their corresponding urban functional areas. Our results show that Beijing can be clustered into five different functional areas based on the analysis of corresponding transit station functions: multimodal interchange hub and leisure area; residential area; employment area; mixed but mainly residential area; and mixed residential and employment area. In addition, we found that urban functional areas have experienced slight changes between 2014 and 2017. The findings can be used to inform urban planning strategies designed to tackle urban spatial structure issues, as well as guiding future policy evaluation of urban landscape pattern use.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten228989" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A contextual hybrid model for vessel movement prediction</div> <div class="author"> Saeed Mehri, Ali Asghar Alesheikh, and <a href="/team/ana">Ana Basiri</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>IEEE Access</em>, Mar 2021 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Predicting the movement of the vessels can significantly improve the management of safety. While the movement can be a function of geographic contexts, the current systems and methods rarely incorporate contextual information into the analysis. This paper initially proposes a novel context-aware trajectories’ simplification method to embed the effects of geographic context which guarantees the logical consistency of the compressed trajectories, and further suggests a hybrid method that is built upon a curvilinear model and deep neural networks. The proposed method employs contextual information to check the logical consistency of the curvilinear method and then, constructs a Context-aware Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) network that can take into account contextual variables, such as the vessel types. The proposed method can enhance the prediction accuracy while maintaining the logical consistency, through a recursive feedback loop. The implementations of the proposed approach on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset, from the eastern coast of the United States of America which was collected, from November to December 2017, demonstrates the effectiveness and better compression, i.e. 80% compression ratio while maintaining the logical consistency. The estimated compressed trajectories are 23% more similar to their original trajectories compared to currently used simplification methods. Furthermore, the overall accuracy of the implemented hybrid method is 15.68% higher than the ordinary Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network which is currently used by various maritime systems and applications, including collision avoidance, vessel route planning, and anomaly detection systems</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten217556" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Inclusivity and diversity of navigation services</div> <div class="author"> <a href="/team/ana">Anahid Basiri</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Navigation</em>, Mar 2021 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Our car seats, watch straps, seatbelts, and gym equipment are all adjustable because of the ’jaggedness principle’, which basically says that nobody is average.

Science and technology always try to push the boundaries and ’improve’; improving the quality of our lives or improving the quality of technologies. We, as researchers in the area of navigation, are no exception; we want to improve the quality of navigation services. And there are many ways to do so, and challenges and limitations to those attempts. Some researchers look to improve the accuracy, the reliability, the integrity through different approaches. Some try to reduce or model noise, some try to minimise human error, and some use novel techniques and algorithms for better prediction. Of course, when ’our horses cannot go any faster’ and there is not much space for improvement for a certain technology or service, researchers may come up with a completely new solution, such as an automobile. Almost all new technologies go through the same exploration period; at the beginning, we want to see how and if it works so we try simple tasks, but then we become more ambitious (or greedier!) and so we introduce it to more difficult challenges until it hits the breaking point. At this point, curious researchers and inventors try to push the boundaries and make the technology better, and if improvement is not possible, they build (invent) a new solution.

In this regard, Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), e.g. Wi-Fi, can be used for positioning purposes by using a WLAN-enabled device, e.g. a smartphone, to measure and match the Received Signal Strength (RSS) of a signal broadcast by an access point. The challenges of this approach are that accurate maps of RSS are required, and that measuring RSS can be affected by many factors, including the dynamics of the environment and the orientation and type of a device.

Many contributors to OSM have not been trained in geography or surveying and consequently their contributions, including geometry and attribute data inserts, deletions, and updates, can be inaccurate, incomplete, inconsistent, or vague. There are some mechanisms and applications dedicated to discovering bugs and errors in OSM data. Such systems can remove errors through user-checks and applying predefined rules but they need an extra control process to check the real-world validity of suspected errors and bugs. This paper focuses on finding bugs and errors based on patterns and rules extracted from the tracking data of users. The underlying idea is that certain characteristics of user trajectories are directly linked to the type of feature. Using such rules, some sets of potential bugs and errors can be identified and stored for further investigations.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright The Geospatial Data Science Group at The University of Glasgow 2025.
