Accurate building height data is essential for diverse applications, from urban air pollution management to autonomous drone delivery and self-driving vehicle navigation. Yet, the data from existing sources such as OpenStreetMap is often incomplete, posing a significant challenge. My research addresses this critical issue by deploying a novel method: using ubiquitous cellular signals as a tool for estimating building heights. The received signal strength (RSS) picked up by ground users from cellular antennas helps to map out a "shadow" area in the vicinity of specific buildings, which implicitly provides essential information that can be used to accurately determine the heights of those buildings. This approach stands out for its efficiency and potential scalability. It could evolve into a crowd-sourced platform, offering a more cost-effective alternative for obtaining accurate urban topographical data. This research not only provides a solution to a persistent data gap but also has wider implications for urban planning, environmental monitoring, and the next wave of autonomous technologies.
