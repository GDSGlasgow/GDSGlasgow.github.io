Multi-Lingual and Multi-Modal Location Information Extraction project aims to use both image and textual data to validate sources of online news and social media posts. Cross validation of locational information extracted from textual data and associated images may help to identify inconsistencies between reported accounts, potentially highlighting sources of online misinformation. In this regard, reliable and accurate geolocation of text and image data will play a crucial role in combatting misinformation, and in aiding counter terrorism efforts.
