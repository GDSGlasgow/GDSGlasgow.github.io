Self-attention mechanism and Transformer architectures have achieved remarkable results in natural language processing and demonstrated their potential for geospatial data processing. However, these models are often designed for specific tasks (or in an ad-hoc manner), which raises the question of whether they can recognize the complex geospatial effects, such as spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity, that underlie the geospatial data. In this study, we first implement an effective self-attention-based model and then evaluate it on various synthetic datasets that contain specific geospatial effects. We examine whether the model can learn the underlying geospatial effects and interactions from the data. Furthermore, we apply the model to real-world datasets for classification/regression tasks and study how the model makes inferences and how trustworthy they are before using it for more real-world applications.
