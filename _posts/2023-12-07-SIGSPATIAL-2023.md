Attending SIGSPATIAL 2023 was an enriching journey! The conference stood at the intersection of GIS, spatial computing, and technological innovation, uniting industry leaders like Alibaba & Google with the forefront of academia.
 
As a PhD student discerning future career paths, I discovered the expansive influence of GIS in areas from risk management to traffic analytics. The Vision Track session was particularly enlightening, showcasing forward-thinking ideas on topics such as open-source mapping, geospatial AI, and spatial data management. These discussions broadened my perspective on the field’s extensive capabilities.
 
Engaging with professionals and peers provided a wealth of knowledge and networking opportunities. The banquet on the last day walked us through SIGSPATIAL’s history, with some of the big names who've shaped this conference over the years – absolutely inspiring.
 
I’ve come away with new ideas, valuable connections, and am ready to dive into the future of geospatial computing! Looking forward to SIGSPATIAL 2024 in Atlanta!
