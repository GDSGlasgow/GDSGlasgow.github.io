The Geospatial Data Science Group (GDSG) sits at the intersection between data science and geospatial data. We explore, analyse, model, and infer from geospatial data to design, develop and provide more intelligent and useful location-based services to make smarter, faster, fairer decisions for inclusive societies.

The GDSG works towards the process of making sense from geospatial data. We use a wide range of geospatial data, including data from state-of-the-art sensors and ‘new forms of data’ such as crowdsourced and social media data, and develop and implement novel models that can handle data challenges such as uncertainty, bias, missingness, or privacy concerns associated with them to have a better understanding of society, cities and citizens.
